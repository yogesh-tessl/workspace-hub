# C-Corp Tax Consultant — NNN Commercial Property

Tax optimization, preparation, and filing guide for C-Corp entities owning single-tenant NNN commercial real estate.

## Quick Reference

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Federal tax rate (C-Corp) | 21% flat |
| TX state income tax | None |
| TX franchise tax | Margin tax, No-tax-due if revenue < ~$2.47M |
| Depreciation building | 39-yr straight-line (nonresidential) |
| Cost seg components | 5yr personal property, 15yr land improvements |
| Bonus depreciation 2025 | 40% (TCJA phase-down: 2026=20%, 2027+=0%) |
| NOL rules | Carry forward indefinitely, 80% of taxable income limit |
| Form 1120 deadline | April 15 (or 15th day of 4th month after FY end) |
| Extension | Form 7004 (auto 2.5 months → Oct 15) |
| TX Franchise deadline | May 15 |

## When to Use This Skill

- Preparing Form 1120 for a C-Corp that owns rental real estate
- Evaluating cost segregation vs standard depreciation
- Managing NOL carryforwards
- Reconciling 1099-MISC reported income vs actual deposits
- Optimizing tax deductions for NNN properties
- Filing Texas Franchise Tax
- Researching direct e-filing options

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Filing Checklist

Before preparing Form 1120, verify:

1. **All income sources identified and quantified:**
   - Rental income (actual deposits, not just 1099)
   - Reimbursements received in calendar year (insurance, HOA, taxes)
   - Other income (late fees, etc.)

2. **1099-MISC reconciliation complete (see Phase 8):**
   - Compare 1099 Box 1 to actual bank deposits
   - Request breakdown from payer if discrepancy exists
   - Document findings — file with tax return if 1099 is wrong

3. **All deductible expenses documented:**
   - Property taxes (all taxing authorities)
   - Insurance premiums
   - Property management fees
   - HOA/POA fees
   - Professional fees (legal, accounting)
   - Repairs and maintenance
   - Depreciation (with cost seg if applicable)

4. **Basis calculations complete:**
   - Purchase price + capitalized closing costs = total basis
   - Land vs building allocation (appraisal ratio or HUD allocation)
   - IRC §164(d) adjustments for property tax proration at closing

---

## Phase 2: Cost Segregation Analysis

### Decision Framework

**When to use cost segregation:**
- Building basis > $500K (generally worthwhile)
- Entity has taxable income to offset (or plans to)
- Property will be held 5+ years

### Component Reclassification

| Component Life | Examples | Typical % | MACRS Life |
|---------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 39-year (structure) | Walls, roof, foundation, structural framing | 65-75% | 39yr |
| 15-year (land improvements) | Parking lot, landscaping, exterior lighting, fencing | 15-20% | 15yr |
| 5-7 year (personal property) | Tenant-specific electrical, HVAC, flooring, fixtures | 10-15% | 5-7yr |

### Bonus Depreciation TCJA Phase-Down

| Year | Bonus Rate |
|------|------------|
| 2025 | 40% |
| 2026 | 20% |
| 2027+ | 0% |

**Strategy note:** 2025 is the last year of meaningful bonus depreciation. Lock in cost segregation now.

### Self-Prepared Study Approach

For simple single-tenant retail/warehouse properties:
1. Use published IRS component percentages (conservative: ≤30% total reclassification)
2. Document methodology with IRS references
3. Keep study file with tax records

IRS references:
- Rev. Proc. 87-56 (asset class lives)
- IRS Cost Segregation Audit Techniques Guide

### Example: Single-Tenant NNN Property

Building basis $1,089,534, placed in service month 9 of tax year:

| Component | Allocation | Basis | Bonus 40% | Regular Y1 | Total Y1 |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Structure (75%) | 39-year | $817,151 | $0 | $6,120 | $6,120 |
| Land improvements (15%) | 15-year | $163,430 | $65,372 | $3,258 | $68,630 |
| Personal property (10%) | 5-year | $108,953 | $43,581 | $10,901 | $54,482 |
| **Total** | | **$1,089,534** | **$108,953** | **$20,279** | **$129,232** |

vs Standard: $8,161 — additional deduction of $121,071 creating NOL of ~$119,784.
This shields ~$96K of 2026 income and ~$42K of 2027 income.

## Phase 3: Form 1120 — Key Lines

### Income Section (Page 1)

| Line | Description | What Goes Here |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| 1a | Gross receipts/sales | (not applicable for pure rental) |
| 5 | Gross rents | **PRIMARY — rental income received** |
| 6 | Other income | Late fees, insurance proceeds |
| 7 | Total income | Sum of 1a–6 |

### Deductions (Schedule A, Page 2)

| Line | Description | Common NNN Items |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 5 | Taxes and licenses | Property taxes |
| 8 | Depreciation | From Form 4562 |
| 12 | Employee benefit programs | Health insurance |
| 13 | Other deductions | Insurance, HOA, mgmt fees, professional fees |

### Required Forms

- Form 1120 (main return)
- Form 8825 (Rental Real Estate Income and Expenses)
- Form 4562 (Depreciation and Amortization)
- Schedule K (Shareholders' Stock and Debt)
- Schedule M-1 (Book-Tax Reconciliation, if required)

---

## Phase 4: NOL Management

### TCJA Rules (Post-2017)

- NOLs carry forward indefinitely (no carryback)
- NOL deduction limited to 80% of taxable income
- Can offset up to 80% of future taxable income each year

### Planning Example

| Year | Rental Income | Deductions | NOL Used | NOL Remaining | Taxable | Tax (21%) |
|------|--------------|------------|----------|--------------|---------|-----------|
| 2025 | $50,086 | $185,000 | N/A | $105,932 | $0 | $0 |
| 2026 | $121,700 | $35,000 | $69,080 | $36,852 | $0 | $0 |
| 2027 | $121,700 | $35,000 | $36,852 | $0 | $49,848 | $10,468 |

**Strategy:** The created NOL shields all of 2025 tax (~$4,938) plus most of 2026.

---

## Phase 5: Tax Optimization Strategies

### 1. Related-Party Loan Interest

If the C-Corp is funded by a related-party loan (e.g., from parent company or shareholder):
- **Charge AFR interest rate** (Applicable Federal Rate ~4-5%)
- C-Corp deducts interest expense (reduces taxable income)
- Interest received by lender is taxable income (may be at lower rate)
- **Net benefit:** shifts income from 21% C-Corp rate to lender's rate

### 2. Management Fee Strategy

- C-Corp can pay management fees to a related management company
- Fees must be **reasonable** and for **actual services rendered**
- Document: bookkeeping, property oversight, tenant communications
- **Deductible at C-Corp level** (21% rate)

### 3. Retirement Plan Contributions

- C-Corp can establish a Solo 401(k) or SEP-IRA
- **Corporate contributions are tax-deductible**
- 2025 Solo 401(k) limit: $69,000 ($76,500 if age 50+)
- Requires earned income (salary) for employee side
- Corporate profit-sharing possible without salary

### 4. Section 179 Expensing

- Can expense up to $1,220,000 of qualifying property in 2025
- Phaseout begins at $3,050,000 of qualifying purchases
- Better than bonus depreciation for equipment under the phaseout threshold
- Qualifies: HVAC, fire suppression, security systems

### 5. De Minimis Safe Harbor Election

- Deduct items ≤ $2,500 per invoice immediately (not capitalize)
- Requires annual election on tax return
- Very useful for property maintenance items

### 6. Entity Structure Considerations

**C-Corp advantages:**
- 21% flat rate (vs individual 24-37%)
- Can retain earnings at 21% for future acquisitions
- More flexible fringe benefits

**S-Corp considerations:**
- Pass-through taxation eliminates double taxation
- Deadline: March 15 (late relief via Rev. Proc. 2013-30)
- QBI deduction generally not available for rental income
- Consult CPA before switching

### 7. Charitable Contributions (if applicable)

- C-Corps can deduct charitable contributions up to 10% of taxable income
- Requires taxable income to utilize (not useful if NOL)

## Phase 6: Form 1120 Filing Plan Structure

When creating a filing plan doc for a C-Corp NNN property:

1. Entity Snapshot (EIN, address, incorporation, NAICS, bank)
2. Property Details (address, tenant, lease, rent, tax accounts)
3. Cost Basis (purchase + closing costs + §164(d) adj; land/building split)
4. Income (all calendar year receipts)
5. Deductions (Schedule A line-by-line)
6. Depreciation (Form 4562: cost seg vs standard, bonus rate)
7. Expected Tax Result (income - deductions; NOL projection)
8. Required Forms (1120, 8825, 4562, K, M-1)
9. E-Filing Options (service comparison with costs)
10. Filing Checklist (pre-filing through post-filing)
11. Key Dates (deadlines, reminders)
12. References (all supporting docs)

Save to `docs/tax/YEAR-filing-plan.md` in the entity repo.

## Phase 7: Texas Franchise Tax

### Overview

Texas has no state income tax but all entities registered with the TX Secretary of State must file a **franchise tax report** annually.

### Filing Details

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Filing URL | comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/franchise/file-forms.php |
| Method | Webfile (online) |
| Deadline | May 15 (annual) |
| No-tax-due threshold | ~$2.47M total revenue |
| Penalty for not filing | $50/month, up to $200 |
| Risk | Business forfeiture after 2+ years of non-filing |

### Steps to File No-Tax-Due Report

1. Go to comptroller.texas.gov
2. Navigate to Franchise Tax → File Forms → Webfile
3. Need: EIN, Texas SOS file number
4. If first time filing, create a Webfile account
5. Select "No-Tax-Due Report" (revenue below threshold)
6. Enter total revenue from Form 1120
7. Submit electronically
8. **Save confirmation number**

---

## Phase 8: Direct E-Filing Options

### Federal Form 1120 E-Filing

| Service | 1120 Support | Cost (est) | E-File? | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-----------|---------|-------|
| IRS Free File | Select providers | Free | Yes | Check irs.gov/freefile |
| TurboTax Business | Yes | ~$200-300 | Yes | Most popular |
| TaxAct Business | Yes | ~$100-200 | Yes | Good value |
| FreeTaxUSA Business | Yes | ~$50-80 | Yes | Budget option |
| TaxSlayer | Limited | Varies | Varies | Check 1120 support |
| Drake Tax | Yes | ~$500+ | Yes | Pro software |
| Lacerte | Yes | ~$1,000+ | Yes | Pro tax suite |
| TaxWise | Yes | ~$500+ | Yes | Pro option |
| UltraTax CS | Yes | ~$1,000+ | Yes | Thomson Reuters |
| CCH Axcess | Yes | ~$1,000+ | Yes | Wolters Kluwer |

**For first-time filers with simple returns:** FreeTaxUSA or TaxAct are recommended (good cost-to-value for Form 1120 + 8825 + 4562).

### Paper Filing Alternative

If e-filing is not available or cost-prohibitive:
- Mail Form 1120 + all schedules + attachments
- Address: Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service Center, Ogden, UT 84201-0012
- Include check for any tax due
- Certified mail recommended

### State E-Filing (Texas Franchise Tax)

- **Texas Comptroller Webfile** is the primary online filing method
- URL: comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/franchise/file-forms.php
- No-cost for No-Tax-Due reports

## Phase 9: 1099-MISC Reconciliation Protocol

### 1099-MISC Reconciliation Step-by-Step

**Step 1: Calculate expected income** — List what you know:
- Rent months × monthly rent = expected rent
- Reimbursements actually received in calendar year (insurance, HOA, etc.)
- Only payments **received in calendar year** count for that year's 1099

**Step 2: Calculate the gap** — 1099 Box 1 minus expected = gap.

**Step 3: Test common fillers for the gap:**
- Property tax proration (total annual tax ÷ 12 × months owned)
- Insurance reimbursement (full Crown/FDIC premium, not just property portion)
- HOA reimbursement
- Prior-year reimbursements included in same check

**Step 4: If gap matches a pass-through item, filing is NOT blocked.**
Property tax reimbursement is income AND expense — they offset. Same for any NNN cost you pay and get reimbursed for. Net taxable impact is $0.

**Step 5: Send clarification email to payer** (email template below) for official confirmation, but do not wait for a reply to file.

**Step 6: If gap is still unexplained and significant by filing deadline:**
- File with actual income (not 1099 amount)
- Attach statement explaining discrepancy
- Keep all correspondence on file

### Quick Gap Formula for NNN Mid-Year Acquisition

```
Expected 1099 = (Months of rent × monthly rent)
              + Insurance reimbursement received in calendar year
              + HOA reimbursement (if received)
              + Property tax proration (annual tax ÷ 12 × months owned)
```

If the reconstructed total is within ~$20 of the 1099, it's rounding. Move on.

---

## Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Don't just report 1099 amount without reconciliation** — it may be wrong
2. **Don't mix calendar year and fiscal year** — 1099 reports calendar year
3. **Don't forget to count reimbursements as income** — they are taxable but offset by corresponding deductions
4. **Don't forget property tax proration at closing** — §164(d) allocation
5. **Don't forget Texas franchise tax** — still required even with zero tax due
6. **Don't miss Form 4562** — depreciation is the biggest deduction
7. **Don't ignore bonus depreciation phase-down** — 2025 = 40%, 2026 = 20%, 2027+ = 0%
8. **Don't commingle personal and corporate** — maintain separate accounts
9. **Watch related-party loan rules** — 0% interest loans may trigger imputed interest (AFR ~4-5%)
10. **Document self-prepared cost seg methodology** — critical for audit defense
11. **Don't skip the M-1 reconciliation** — required when income/assets > $250K
12. **Don't forget Form 8825** — required for C-Corp rental real estate
