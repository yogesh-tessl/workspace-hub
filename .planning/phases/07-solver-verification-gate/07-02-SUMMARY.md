requires:
  - phase: 07-01
    provides: OrcFxAPI verification on licensed-win-1
provides:
  - Git-based job queue for solver dispatch (queue/pending/, completed/, failed/)
  - Job submission script (submit-job.sh) for dev-primary
  - Queue processor (process-queue.py) for licensed-win-1 with OrcFxAPI integration
  - Windows Task Scheduler setup script (setup-scheduler.ps1) for 30-min polling

patterns-established:
  - "Git-based pull queue: dev-primary commits job YAML to queue/pending/, licensed-win-1 polls via git pull"
  - "YAML job schema with required (solver, input_file) and optional (export_excel, description) fields"
  - "Queue processor handles both orcawave and orcaflex solver types"

# Phase 07 Plan 02: Queue Infrastructure Summary

**Git-based pull queue for solver dispatch: job submission, queue processor with OrcFxAPI, and Windows Task Scheduler setup for 30-minute polling on licensed-win-1**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-03-30T22:25:39Z
- **Completed:** 2026-03-30T22:28:30Z
- **Tasks:** 1 of 2 (Task 2 is checkpoint:human-action -- awaiting user setup on licensed-win-1)
- **Files created:** 7

## Accomplishments
- Created complete git-based job queue infrastructure (pending/completed/failed directories)
- Built job submission script that validates solver type and input file, creates YAML, commits, and pushes
- Built queue processor with OrcFxAPI integration for both OrcaWave and OrcaFlex solvers
- Created one-time Windows Task Scheduler setup script for 30-minute polling

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create queue infrastructure and scripts** - `bc3d654b` (feat)

**Task 2: One-time Task Scheduler setup on licensed-win-1** - checkpoint:human-action (awaiting user)

## Files Created/Modified
- `queue/pending/.gitkeep` - Pending jobs directory marker
- `queue/completed/.gitkeep` - Completed jobs directory marker
- `queue/failed/.gitkeep` - Failed jobs directory marker
- `queue/job-schema.yaml` - Schema documenting YAML job format with examples
- `scripts/solver/submit-job.sh` - Job submission helper (creates YAML, commits, pushes)
- `scripts/solver/process-queue.py` - Queue processor (OrcFxAPI solver execution on licensed-win-1)
- `scripts/solver/setup-scheduler.ps1` - One-time Task Scheduler setup for 30-min polling

## Decisions Made
- Used pull-based git queue architecture instead of SSH push -- corporate firewall blocks inbound connections to licensed-win-1
- Made PyYAML optional with a built-in flat-key parser fallback -- reduces dependency requirements on licensed-win-1
- Used Python 3.9-compatible type hints (typing.Optional/List) since OrcFxAPI supports Python 3.9+

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed Python 3.10+ type hint syntax for 3.9 compatibility**
- **Found during:** Task 1 (process-queue.py creation)
- **Issue:** Used `list | None` union syntax which requires Python 3.10+; OrcFxAPI supports Python 3.9+
- **Fix:** Changed to `Optional[List[str]]` from `typing` module
- **Files modified:** scripts/solver/process-queue.py
- **Verification:** py_compile passes
- **Committed in:** bc3d654b (Task 1 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (1 bug fix)
**Impact on plan:** Minor syntax fix for Python version compatibility. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required

**Task 2 is a checkpoint:human-action.** User must perform one-time setup on licensed-win-1:

1. Pull latest repo on licensed-win-1
2. Run `setup-scheduler.ps1` as Administrator
3. Verify task created with `Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'SolverQueue'`
4. Test manual run and check logs
5. Verify OrcFxAPI is importable

## Known Stubs
None -- all scripts are fully functional (queue processor handles empty queue gracefully).

## Next Phase Readiness
- Queue infrastructure committed and ready for use
- Task Scheduler setup awaiting user action on licensed-win-1
- Once Task 2 completes, queue-based solver dispatch is live for Phase 07-03
