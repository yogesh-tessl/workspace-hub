# Project State

## Current Focus

Phase 02: Accelerate worldenergydata pipelines -- IN PROGRESS

## Current Position

Phase 02 — Wave 1 complete (4/6 plans), proceeding to Wave 2

## Progress

- Plans: 4/6 complete (Phase 02)

## Decisions

- Edition field typed as int|str to handle year-only and month-specific editions
- Functions list requires min_length=1 to ensure manifests provide traceability data
- validate_manifest_file wraps errors in ValueError with file path for CI clarity
- StabilityResult is a NamedTuple with (utilisation, is_stable, details) for audit trail
- Zero/negative submerged weight returns inf utilisation rather than raising exceptions
- Lift force uses U^2 (always positive) matching DNV-RP-F109 Eq 3.2 formulation
- Burst check uses effective thickness (t - corrosion_allowance) per ASME B31.4 S403.2.1
- Zero effective thickness returns inf utilisation rather than raising exception
- Collapse and propagation use nominal wall thickness consistent with B31.8 pattern
- Wave spectrum provided via injectable callable for scatter fatigue decoupling
- Zero Hs sea states produce zero damage silently (calm sea valid in scatter tables)
- Transfer function accepts both callable and ndarray forms
- Scatter fatigue gap removed from registry (now implemented via scatter_fatigue_damage)
- On-bottom stability gap removed from subsea/pipeline registry entry
- New modules registered at development maturity (needs field validation)
- Coverage tests added to raise scatter_fatigue above 80% threshold
- Parquet utility uses snappy compression via pyarrow engine for cross-adapter consistency
- EIA adapter catches all exceptions and returns failure JobResult rather than raising
- JSONL-to-Parquet conversion scans output_dir for eia_*.jsonl files post-ingestion
- BSEE adapter uses inline df.to_parquet() to avoid cross-plan dependency
- Each BSEE dataset processed independently with partial failure tolerance
- BSEE adapter uses stdlib logging (not loguru) to match scheduler patterns
- SODIR adapter uses client.get() with table query param for uniform endpoint handling
- Partial failure returns success status since data was written for remaining endpoints
- Used Pydantic BaseModel (not dataclass) for CSV validation per D-06 requirement
- Tier 2 stubs return status=skipped to avoid triggering monitoring alerts
- [Phase 02]: AlertSender._enabled = bool(smtp_host and smtp_user and smtp_pass) for clean no-op fallback
- [Phase 02]: check_staleness treats missing jobs as stale (never-run = always stale)

## Session

- Last session: 2026-03-26T04:42:00Z
- Stopped at: Wave 1 complete — merging results before Wave 2
